# github-slack-notifier

This repository implements the [GitHub Notifier by Krauters](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-notifier-by-krauters), a GitHub Action that posts open pull requests to Slack on a scheduled basis to help teams stay updated.

## How It Works
- **Triggers**: The action runs on a schedule (e.g., every weekday at 15:00, 17:00, etc.).
- **Notifications**: Sends open pull request details to specified Slack channels.
